This package implements a documentation of most HPP software packages. 
It includes:
  -1. information about how to install HPP software,
  -2. information about how to develop in HPP
  -3. a front page with links to the packages constituting HPP.

Item 3 implies that this documentation depends on all the documented packages.
To make possible the installation of this documentation without primarily
installing all the necessary packages, all the dependencies have been 
commented out in the configure.ac file:

dnl if PKG_CHECK_MODULES(XXX, xxx); then
dnl 	XXX_PREFIX=`$PKG_CONFIG xxx --variable=prefix`
dnl 	AC_SUBST(XXX_PREFIX)
dnl fi

It is recommended to do the following operations:
  1. install documentation as such (see INSTALL)
  2. install HPP packages you need (Related Pages->How to install HPP)
  3. uncomment in configure.ac the packages you have installed and of 
     which you want to access the documentation (remove dnl 
     at the beginning of the selected lines
